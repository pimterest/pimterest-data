{"title":"DGS - Dragon Go Server","description":"The Dragon Go Server (DGS) is a place where you can play turn-based Go (aka Baduk or Weichi) with other players from around the world in different time zones. It functions more or less the same way as playing Go via email but just using your web browser. DGS also provides discussion forums about Go.","image":"https://www.dragongoserver.net/images/dragonlogo_bl.jpg","domainName":"dragongoserver.net","source":"rss","type":"link"}
